# Dictionaries are data structures used to map arbitrary keys to values.
# Lists can be thought of as dictionaries with integer keys within a certain range.
# Dictionaries can be indexed in the same way as lists, using square brackets containing keys.
# Example:
ages = {"Dave": 24, "Mary": 42, "John": 58}
print(ages["Dave"])
print(ages["Mary"])

# Result:
"""
24
42
"""

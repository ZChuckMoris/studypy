# You have already seen exceptions in previous code.
# They occur when something goes wrong, due to incorrect code or input.
# When an exception occurs, the program immediately stops.
# The following code produces the ZeroDivisionError exception by trying to divide 7 by 0.

num1 = 7
num2 = 0
print(num1/num2)

# Result:
# ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
